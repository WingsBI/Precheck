# Authentication Persistence Fix

## Problem
Users were getting logged out when refreshing the page because the authentication state was not being persisted across browser refreshes.

## Root Cause
- Redux store resets to initial state on page refresh
- Token was stored in localStorage but not restored to Redux state
- ProtectedRoute component only checked Redux state, not localStorage

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Auth Slice (`src/store/slices/authSlice.ts`)
- **Added `isInitialized` state** to track auth initialization status
- **Added `getInitialAuthState()` helper** to check localStorage on app startup
- **Added `initializeAuth` async thunk** to validate and restore tokens
- **Enhanced token expiration checking** with automatic cleanup
- **Updated initial state** to load from localStorage immediately

### 2. Updated ProtectedRoute (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`)
- **Added loading screen** while authentication is being initialized
- **Checks `isInitialized` state** before making routing decisions
- **Better UX** with loading spinner during auth check

### 3. Enhanced App.tsx
- **Added AuthProvider component** to initialize auth on app startup
- **Dispatches `initializeAuth`** when app loads
- **Ensures authentication state is restored** before routing begins

### 4. Improved API Interceptors (`src/services/api.ts`)
- **Proactive token expiration checking** before API requests
- **Automatic logout and redirect** when tokens expire
- **Enhanced 401 error handling** with proper cleanup

## Key Features

### ✅ **Persistent Authentication**
- Authentication state survives page refreshes
- Tokens are validated and restored from localStorage
- Expired tokens are automatically cleaned up

### ✅ **Token Expiration Handling**
- Proactive expiration checking before API calls
- Automatic logout when tokens expire
- Clean removal of expired tokens from storage

### ✅ **Better User Experience**
- Loading spinner during authentication initialization
- No unexpected redirects to login when already authenticated
- Smooth transitions between authenticated and unauthenticated states

### ✅ **Security Improvements**
- Token validation on every app startup
- Automatic cleanup of invalid/expired tokens
- Proper logout handling with state cleanup

## How It Works

1. **App Startup**: `AuthProvider` calls `initializeAuth()`
2. **Token Check**: System checks localStorage for existing token
3. **Token Validation**: Validates token format and expiration
4. **State Restoration**: If valid, restores user data to Redux state
5. **Route Protection**: `ProtectedRoute` waits for initialization before routing
6. **API Security**: Every API call checks token validity proactively

## Files Modified
- `src/store/slices/authSlice.ts` - Enhanced auth state management
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx` - Added initialization checking
- `src/App.tsx` - Added auth initialization on startup
- `src/services/api.ts` - Enhanced token expiration handling

## Testing
- ✅ Login and refresh page - should stay logged in
- ✅ Wait for token expiration - should auto-logout
- ✅ Manual logout - should clear all state and storage
- ✅ Direct URL access when authenticated - should work
- ✅ Direct URL access when not authenticated - should redirect to login
