- Flexible layouts using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- Optimized for all screen sizes (320px → 2560px+)
- High contrast and accessibility support

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API calls
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for large datasets
- Cross-browser compatibility testing

## 📊 Performance Targets
